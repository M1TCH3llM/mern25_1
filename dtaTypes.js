// DatType In JavaScript
// JavaScript has dynamic typing, meaning variables can hold any data type and can change types at runtime.

//1. Primary Data Types
// const primaryDataTypes = {
//     string: "A sequence of characters",
//     number: "Numeric values, both integers and floats",
//     boolean: "True or false values",
//     null: "A special value representing no value",
//     undefined: "A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value",
//     symbol: "A unique and immutable value often used as object property keys",
//     BigInt: "An integer with arbitrary precision, introduced in ES2020"
// };

//2. Reference Data Types
// const referenceDataTypes = {
//     object: "A collection of key-value pairs, can include arrays and functions",
//     array: "An ordered list of values, which are also objects in JavaScript",
//     function: "A block of code designed to perform a particular task, also an object"
// };

Value = null;

console.log(typeof Value); // Output: "object" (null is a special case in JavaScript)
